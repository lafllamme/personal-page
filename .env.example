                    # =============================================
                    #
                    # This monorepo uses WORKSPACE-SPECIFIC environment files:
                    #
                    # üìÅ cms/.env         - Contains all CMS (Payload) configuration
                    # üé® frontend/.env     - Contains all Frontend (Nuxt) configuration
                    #
                    # No root .env file is needed! Each workspace is self-contained.
                    #
                    # To set up:
                    # 1. Copy cms/.env.example to cms/.env and fill in your values
                    # 2. Copy frontend/.env.example to frontend/.env and fill in your values
                    #
