Voice

confident but never arrogant

Tone rules
keep it human
keep it crisp
avoid hype and fear
avoid marketing language
avoid filler intros

We can be slightly playful, but never sloppy.
If something is uncertain, we say so.

## Post formats

Default format is short reads.
Most posts should take 2 to 3 minutes.

We also support
curated weekly features
deeper editor picks
evergreen explainers

Curated posts should feel intentional and nicely composed, not like a dump of links.

## Article structure standards

A good post usually includes:

Title
specific and factual
no bait titles

Lead
one to two sentences that summarize the story

What happened
key facts in a tight paragraph

Why it matters
practical implications for builders, teams, or users

Key details
bullet list of the most important points
prefer numbers, names, dates, and concrete claims

What to watch next
what might happen next, or what remains unknown

Sources
always link sources clearly

## Sourcing and trust rules

Do not invent facts.
Do not assume details that are not in sources.
If data is missing, omit it or say it is not confirmed.

Prefer primary sources
company announcements and blogs
official documentation
papers and preprints
filings and court docs

When using secondary sources
attribute clearly
cross check when possible

If sources disagree
present both sides
do not force certainty

## UX goals

Fast to scan, great to read.

Skimmable
strong headings
short paragraphs
use bullet lists for dense info
show the key point early

Readable typography
comfortable line length
clear hierarchy
excellent mobile reading

## Design direction

Keywords
sleek
minimal
premium
editorial
modern

Visual principles
whitespace is a feature
typography does the heavy lifting
details matter
motion is subtle and purposeful

Avoid visual noise.
Avoid loud gradients and heavy effects.
A clean interface should feel confident, not empty.

Preferred styling
dark friendly
soft borders
subtle shadows
crisp dividers
high contrast for text
muted accent color for links and highlights

## Interaction and motion

Motion should add polish and comprehension, not attention grabbing drama.

Allowed
subtle fades and slides
micro interactions on hover and focus
smooth layout transitions
small delightful details when they do not hurt performance

Not allowed
bouncy overshoots
constant animated backgrounds
flashy effects that compete with reading

Performance over motion.
If in doubt, remove motion.
